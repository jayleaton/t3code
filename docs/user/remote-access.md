# Remote access

Connect a phone, browser, or another desktop app to Ada running on a different
machine. That machine must stay running and reachable while you work.

In **Settings → Environments**, open a machine’s **More actions** menu to rename it or
choose its icon (including desktop, laptop, and server). Names and icons are saved on
that machine and shown on connected devices. **Reset name** restores the original name.

Other devices reach the machine directly: over your local network, over
Tailscale, or through SSH from the desktop app.

T3 Connect has been removed. Mobile push notifications, Live Activities, and
guest links went with it.

### Coming from T3 Connect

- **Machines you reached only through T3 Connect** are dropped from your saved
  environments. The app tells you once which ones, so you can pair them again
  directly over your network or Tailscale. Machines that also had a direct
  route keep it and its sign-in.
- **On the host,** the update deletes its local T3 Connect credentials and the
  tunnel tool, and signs out devices that came in through T3 Connect. It does
  not contact the T3 Connect service, so the machine stays listed there. To
  release it, unlink T3 Connect in Settings on an older version before you
  update.
- **Webhook and MCP addresses** now work only from devices on your tailnet.
  Services on the internet, such as GitHub or a hosted assistant, cannot reach
  them.
- **Going back to an older version** does not restore T3 Connect on that
  machine. Link it again from the start there, and pair your phone again.

## Pair over a LAN or private network

Use direct pairing when the other device can reach the host's network address.

On a desktop host, open **Settings → Environments**, enable **Network access**,
then create a pairing link using an address the other device can reach. Changing
network access restarts the desktop app. You can turn it off in the same place.

For a command-line host, run `ada up` and choose the local network, or run:

```bash
ada up --lan
```

On Linux and macOS, `ada up` then runs Ada as a
[background service](./background-service.md). The background service is not
available on Windows, so there `ada up` prints the `ada serve` command to keep
running in a terminal. Run `ada up` again to change your choice, and `ada status`
to see it. `ada up` asks nothing when you pass `--lan` or `--no-lan`, and `--yes`
takes the defaults; `ada up --help` lists every flag.

For a server in a terminal, run `ada serve --lan`. Either way, Ada then
accepts connections from your local network and tailnet, so a pairing code is
all that keeps other devices on them out.

If a server is already running, generate a fresh link without restarting it:

```bash
ada pair
```

Scan the QR code on your phone or paste the pairing URL into **Add environment**
in the receiving app. Connection settings are under **Settings → Environments**
on web, desktop and mobile. A loopback address
such as `127.0.0.1` reaches only the device opening the link.

On a computer with the desktop app, you can open the printed `t3code://pair`
app link instead. The desktop app asks you to confirm the server address, then
adds it.

If your HTTPS endpoint uses a certificate from your own certificate authority,
install that CA on Android as a **CA certificate** in its security settings; the
Android app then trusts it.

Pairing authorizes that device for future connections. Use a fresh one-time link
for each new device; you do not need the original token to reconnect. Links
created in Settings can only be copied from the client that created them while
its Environments page stays open. If you leave or reload that page, create
another link to share.

### Reach one machine several ways

A machine can have more than one route: LAN, Tailscale, another VPN, a public
URL, or SSH. Tailscale shares its `100.64.0.0/10` address range with
other VPNs such as Cloudflare WARP, so an address in that range shows as VPN
unless the machine confirms it is on Tailscale. To add a route, choose **Add
route** in the machine's route list.
A pairing link for a saved machine is refused when it comes from an address
that machine does not have yet; add that address with **Add route** instead.
Pairing again over an address the machine already has still works. A new route
is placed by speed, in that order, and you can reorder routes at any time.

While connected through a paired address, Ada also learns the machine's
current LAN and Tailscale addresses and adds them as routes. When the
machine's LAN address changes, for example after it joins another Wi-Fi network,
the learned route follows it. The machine must allow network access for its LAN
address to be learned: **Network access** in the desktop app, or the
[local network](./background-service.md#local-network-access) choice in `ada up`.
You can reorder a learned route, but not remove it; it
goes away with the route it was learned through, or when the machine stops
reporting that address.

Ada connects over the first route that answers. Away from home, a LAN
address that does not answer is checked briefly and skipped. It is only tried
again, after the other routes, if none of them connect. While connected over a
later route, Ada checks earlier routes on a faster kind of network (LAN
before Tailscale, Tailscale before a public address) when your network changes, when
you return to the app, and every minute, and moves as soon as one works. It
does not drop a working connection for an earlier route of the same kind, such
as two Tailscale addresses; the order decides which is tried first next time.

On web and desktop, select the route count under the machine's name in
**Settings → Environments** to see its routes. Drag a route to change the order,
or remove it. On mobile, open the machine under **Settings → Environments** and
choose **Edit**.

Open **Permissions** next to **Routes** in web or desktop, or **Your permissions**
in the mobile route details, to see what your current connection can do on that
environment. For a remote environment, this is in its route details. Permissions
shown there apply only to the route marked **In use**; other routes are not
checked. Each pairing has its own session and may grant different permissions.

### Balance new threads across machines

Auto balance is off by default. On web and desktop, enable it in
**Settings → Environments → Load balancing** to automatically choose a machine for
new threads in projects grouped across connected environments. The section
appears once two or more machines are switched on.
Each machine starts at **Normal**. Choose **Prefer** to favor it when it has CPU and
memory available, **Less often** to reduce its share, or **Manual only** to exclude
it from automatic selection. These are preferences, not fixed traffic percentages.
Preferences are saved separately in each client.

The composer checks eligible machines when choosing a draft's environment, then keeps
that choice stable. Choose **Auto balance** again to check current resources, or choose
a specific machine to override it. Choosing a branch or worktree also keeps the draft
on that machine. Existing threads stay where they started. If resource checks are
unavailable or all eligible machines are full, choose a machine manually to continue.
Mobile keeps its manual environment selection.

### Tailscale HTTPS

Join both devices to the same tailnet. In the desktop app, enable **Tailscale
HTTPS** in **Settings → Environments**. Turn it off there to remove that route.

A command-line server publishes itself on the tailnet with Tailscale HTTPS by
default, and its startup log says so. To keep a server off the tailnet:

```bash
ada serve --no-tailscale-serve
```

Setting `T3CODE_TAILSCALE_SERVE=false` in the server's environment does the same.

For an already-running server:

```bash
ada pair --tailscale
```

The pairing link uses an address such as `https://machine.tailnet.ts.net/`.
The mapping created by `pair --tailscale` persists across restarts. Remove its
default-port mapping with:

```bash
tailscale serve --https=443 --set-path=/ off
```

If that port is already in use, choose another with
`--tailscale-serve-port`. See `ada pair --help` for other pairing options.

### Hosted web app

[app.t3.codes](https://app.t3.codes) needs an HTTPS endpoint. It connects directly
to your server; a hosted pairing link does not make an unreachable backend
reachable or convert HTTP to HTTPS.

A Tailscale HTTPS address works from a browser on the same tailnet. For a plain
HTTP LAN endpoint, use the direct pairing URL in a browser that can
open it, or pair from the desktop app. On mobile, an IP address entered without a
scheme uses HTTP, so include `https://` when your server uses HTTPS.

## Desktop-managed SSH

In the desktop app, open **Settings → Environments → Add machine**, choose
**SSH**, and enter a host or SSH alias such as `user@example.com`. Ada starts
or reuses a server there and opens the port forward for you. Projects, provider
credentials, and agent work stay on the remote machine.

The remote host must be Linux or an Apple Silicon Mac with `curl` or `wget`,
`tar`, `sha256sum` or `shasum`, and [provider setup](./install.md#providers).
The first launch downloads Ada's server to `~/.t3/runtime` on the host, so
it takes longer than later ones.
Provider CLIs must be on the `PATH` of a non-interactive login shell there;
check with:

```bash
ssh user@example.com 'sh -lc "command -v claude codex"'
```

If SSH reconnecting fails after an app update, retry the launch once. Removing
the connection stops a server that Ada launched; a server that was already
running is left alone.

Each desktop app keeps one session on the host for its SSH connection and reuses
it when it reconnects. Revoke sessions you no longer use in **Settings →
Environments** on the host, or on a headless host with `ada auth session list` and
`ada auth session revoke <id>`. A desktop that can still sign in over SSH pairs
again on its next connect.

For Antigravity's Google callback on a remote host, see
[remote sign-in](./providers-antigravity.md#sign-in-from-a-remote-device).

## Browser on a remote environment

Browser tabs belong to the environment, so you and your agents see the same
tabs from any device. The desktop app shows its own environment's tabs
directly. Every other device, and the desktop app for other environments,
streams them from the host. Agents keep using them while no device is
connected, and `localhost` addresses reach servers on the host.

The first tab downloads a headless Chrome, about 120 MB, into the Ada home. It
is the same browser [HTML renders](html-renders.md) use, so a host downloads it
only once. Some Linux hosts need [setup](#browser-host-setup) before it can
start.

Agent tabs have separate storage and share a Chromium process. Take control before
typing into an agent's tab, then release control when you want the agent to
continue. Read-only connections can watch without changing the page.

While you have control, the tab works with your device: text the page copies or
cuts goes to your clipboard, a file picker on the page opens your device's
picker, and a finished download is offered for you to save. Popups such as
sign-in windows open as their own tabs. Downloads stay on the host until the
tab closes. Audio does not play on your device.

On a phone, tap the floating preview's corner dot to show its controls, then
**Pop into separate window** to keep watching in picture-in-picture over other
apps.

### Local servers

The browser lists ports held by processes your terminals and agents started.
Ada reads which process holds each port and never connects to it, so a
listed port opens as `http://localhost:<port>` and might not be a web page. For
an HTTPS server or a specific path, set the **Preview URL** on the project
script that starts it; Ada checks that address and opens it as written.

To stop listing ports, set `T3CODE_PORT_DISCOVERY=0` in the environment that
starts the Ada server, such as
[`service.env`](./background-service.md#configure-the-service-environment) for
the background service, and restart it. Script preview URLs still appear.

### Browser host setup

macOS, Windows, and Linux desktops run the browser as is. Some Linux hosts need
one-time setup: Ubuntu 23.10 and later block the sandbox the browser runs in,
and minimal images and containers lack libraries it loads. When that happens,
the server says so at startup, and browser tabs and HTML previews show the
command to run on the host:

```sh
sudo ada browser setup
```

The server shows the exact line for how you started it, and keeps your `PATH`
when you started it with `npx` and Node is installed only for your user. Where `ada` is not on your `PATH`, such as with only the
desktop app installed, it names the full path of the app's own `ada` instead. It allows Chrome's sandbox with an AppArmor profile and installs
any missing libraries and system fonts with apt; pages that load without text
can mean the host has no fonts. It is safe to run again, and each run reloads
the AppArmor profile: run it again if the browser reports a blocked sandbox on a
host restored from an image or snapshot, where the profile can be on disk
without being loaded. Without `sudo`, it only reports what it would change.

The browser runs in Chrome's sandbox by default. Chrome cannot start that sandbox
as root. If your Ada server runs as root, run it as a nonroot user to keep
sandboxing enabled. `ada browser setup` does not fix this root restriction.

If you need to run as root, or cannot enable the sandbox on your host, set
`T3CODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0` in the **Ada server's environment** and restart
the server. This disables Chrome's sandbox. For a manual launch:

```sh
T3CODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0 ada serve
```

For a systemd service, add `Environment=T3CODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0` under
`[Service]` in its configuration, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, then restart
your Ada service. Setting the variable in an agent's terminal does not change the
environment of an already running Ada server.

## Connect an outside agent

Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT and other agents Ada did not start can drive
threads on an environment through its MCP server. See
[outside agents](./outside-agents.md) for setup.

## Link another environment

Link two machines, such as your laptop and a VPS, and agents on one can work on
the other: launch, message, wait on and stop its threads, answer their
questions, and manage their queues. Linked agents cannot change the other
machine's projects, settings or scheduled tasks.

Open **Settings → Environments → Machines** on web, desktop and mobile. Machines
in your network show up here by themselves and open by themselves in every app
of the network. Add a machine once and every app in your network can use it.
Machines outside the network, such as a VPS paired by code or an SSH host, are
rows in the same list.

Each row has a switch, **Show in this app**. It only affects this app: switch it
off to disconnect the machine here, on to bring it back. Other apps are not
affected. A row reads **Connected**, **Connecting…**, **Offline**, or **Off in
this app**. **Can't connect · retrying** means the last try failed and the app
tries again on its own, waiting longer each time.

To stop agents using a link, open the row's **…** menu and choose **Pause agent
links**. While it is paused on either machine, agents start nothing over a link
between them. A task already running on the other machine still finishes, and
if that machine has agent links paused, its result arrives once they are back.
While this app's machines have agent links paused, rows it is not connected to
read **Agent links paused**, because nothing opens them until you resume.

**+ Add machine** offers a Tailscale machine, a pairing code, or SSH. **Remove**
is for machines outside the network. A machine in the network is switched off
here or forgotten from the network instead.

A phone that is not on your tailnet shows network machines as **Can't reach from
this phone**. On app.t3.codes, a machine reachable only over plain HTTP shows
**Can't reach from this browser**. Open the app from a machine on your network,
or use Tailscale HTTPS.

### Your device network

Machines running Ada on your Tailscale account show up in **Machines** on
your other machines. Being on the same account is not permission: a machine
joins only when you add it and pick what it may do. Adding the first one starts
your network, with the machine you added from at full access. Tagged nodes and
machines shared from someone else's tailnet never show up. A machine
reinstalled on the same computer shows as one row, and you can **Forget** its
old install from that row.

Changes go through a full-access machine this app is connected to, and every
machine in the network picks them up.

- **Add to network** gives a machine the access you pick on every machine. A
  limit one machine already set for it stays until you clear it. **Link to … only** links it to one machine, as a pairing code would.
  A machine linked that way, or with a pairing code, can be added to the
  network later.
- A machine must agree before another machine adds it or links to it: on it,
  choose **Allow joining**. That stays open for 10 minutes, and the list shows
  until when. A machine already in a network needs this too before a link
  from outside it.
- A member's access is the most it may do on every machine. A full-access
  machine can narrow it, **Revoke** it everywhere, or restore it at a level you
  pick. **Only on …: limit** narrows it on one machine alone; choose **No
  limit** to clear it.
- **Forget** removes a machine from the list. A member is revoked everywhere
  first, so it cannot rejoin by itself. If it is still on your tailnet, it
  shows up again as a machine you can add.
- **Leave network** takes a machine out of the network. Other apps that reach
  it through the network are signed out, and the others see it as left. The
  app you leave from keeps its connection until that session ends, 30 days
  after it was issued, and its row shows until when; nothing renews it. The
  only full-access machine cannot leave while other members remain: give
  another machine full access first. The others then show it as **Left the
  network**; to bring it back before the session ends, choose **Allow
  joining** on it, then **Add again** on its row from a full-access machine.
  After that, pair with it by code.
- After updating from a version before machines were tied to their Tailscale
  identity, machines that were linked both ways (by Tailscale or by pairing
  code) and still hold those links reconnect on their own, at the access they
  had, and come out as one network. Any other member shows **Needs re-adding
  after the update**, and the other machines refuse it until then. Choose
  **Add again** on its row from a full-access machine; if this app is not also
  connected to that machine, first choose **Allow joining** on it.
- A machine that is in another of your networks shows **Merge networks**.
  Adding it makes the two networks one, and every machine and app keeps the
  access it has. A machine you forgot shows **Restore** once it is found on
  your tailnet again.
- Below full access, a member opens read-only, and its row shows **Connected ·
  read-only in this app**.
- When you create a pairing link on a full-access member, **Works on all your
  network's machines** pairs the phone or browser with the whole network at
  once. It is listed under **Phones and browsers** once it pairs. Apps are full
  access or read-only. **Make read-only** or **Revoke** signs it out
  everywhere. To give it more access or bring it back, choose **Pair again** on
  web or desktop and open the new link on that device; it replaces the old
  entry on every machine. If the network no longer lists the old entry, choose
  **Pair as new** instead, then forget the old entry.
- Other people's machines, and anything off your tailnet, still link with a
  pairing code as described below.

### Link with a pairing code

Open the **…** menu in the **Machines** header, choose **Link for agents**, and pick the other machine or enter its address. The list
holds the machines this app knows. If this
app has an address for that machine and is connected to it with a session that
manages access there, it makes the pairing code itself; otherwise paste one
from that machine's **Settings → Environments**. An address you type always
needs a pasted code. From a terminal, use
`ada environment link <address> --pairing-code <code> --access <mode>`.

You can also ask an agent to link a machine by name, such as "delegate this to
my vps". It shows a card in the thread where you pick the machine the same way
and the access, then approve. An address the agent gives that this app does
not know for one of your machines also needs a pasted code. Paste one only for
an address you trust: the code is sent there.

- The access you pick is the most agents from this machine may do there. An
  agent also never gets more there than its own mode here.
- Threads a link starts are marked **From** and this machine's name there.
- A full-access link works there like that machine's own agents. Below full
  access, the link's agents can change only threads it started, not that
  machine's own threads, projects or settings, and they skip its project setup
  scripts.
- The link shows up in that machine's **Settings → Environments** like any
  outside agent. Revoke it there to end it. **Forget** on this machine only
  removes it here.
- Links last 30 days. Link again with a new pairing code to renew one.

An agent can also hand a task to a linked machine with `delegate_task`: it runs
there as an ordinary thread, in the project with the same repository (or the
one `target.projectId` names), and this thread wakes with its result when it
ends, as for any delegated task. It keeps following the task across restarts.
If the other machine revokes the link, or the link is removed here, the task
fails with that reason.

## Manage or revoke access

On the host, **Settings → Environments** lets authorized administrators create
pairing links and revoke client sessions. Revoking an unused link prevents new
pairings; revoke a device's session to remove its existing access. **Revoke
others** ends every other paired phone, browser, desktop, and linked machine at
once. A revoked device says the machine revoked its pairing; to restore it,
create a fresh pairing link and use **Pair again** in the connection details on
that device. Its saved threads stay. Command-line management is
available through `ada auth --help`.

When the app connects to more than one environment, choose one at the top of the
page. A desktop app with **Local environment** off can manage a background
service on the same machine this way.

A session with an open connection stays listed after its access credential
expires.

To choose a token's permissions, pass `--scope` once for each scope you want:

```sh
ada pair --scope orchestration:read --scope filesystem:read
```

The selected scopes replace the default permissions. The same option works with
`ada auth pairing create` and `ada auth session issue`; each command's
`--help` lists the available scopes. Without `--scope`, pairing tokens and issued
bearer sessions get every permission, including managing access.
A terminal or a full-access agent on the host can reach those as well, so a
client that should not manage access also needs to go without `terminal:operate`
and `orchestration:operate`.

To change an existing client's permissions, create a fresh pairing link with the
scopes it needs. In a browser opened directly on the environment, open that link
to replace the browser's current grant. For mobile or a saved remote environment
in web or desktop, use **Add Environment** with the fresh link or code; pairing
the same environment replaces its saved grant. Reconnecting alone does not change
permissions.

Grouping checkouts does not combine their permissions. Shared project settings
require `orchestration:operate` on every member environment; actions on one
checkout use that checkout's permissions.

`source-control:write` covers direct Git and pull request changes made from the
client: pushing, switching or creating branches, cloning, and removing
worktrees. It does not restrict what a task does. Starting a task in a new
worktree still creates that branch and worktree with `orchestration:operate`,
and the agent it runs can use Git however the environment allows.

Settings changes, provider management, environment maintenance, and access
management can each be granted separately. New
pairings without `--scope` include all of them. Existing clients keep the
permissions they paired with and can stay connected after an update, but newly
separated features may require pairing again with the permissions they need.
Older clients may show controls that the server denies. Create a fresh pairing
link to change a client's permissions.

`filesystem:read` allows browsing host files, opening workspace files, and viewing
local changes. Add `filesystem:write` to allow editing files or saving plans to
the workspace. These scopes control direct file access from the client.

Treat pairing URLs and authorization codes as passwords. Do not include them in
screenshots, logs, or bug reports.

## Use MCP with connected environments

Agents in Ada chats always have the Ada tools for the machine they run on. To let
them act on your other machines too, enable **Settings → Environments → MCP Gateway** in the desktop app and
grant access to each environment involved, including the one the chat runs on. Keep this
desktop connected while agents use it; calls for other machines go through it, under the
grants you set. Disabling the gateway stops those calls immediately.

For assistants outside Ada, copy the external MCP host configuration from the same page.
For standalone OpenCode, merge **Copy OpenCode config** into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`
on the desktop's machine, preserving existing servers, then reconnect OpenCode. Other hosts
using `mcpServers` can use **Copy MCP config**. The copied configuration includes the bridge
token and the desktop's state-file path.

A server can also host its own gateway, without the desktop app: in the browser, on the desktop
app for a connected server, or in mobile Settings → Maintenance → **Agent gateway**, turn on
**Server gateway** for that environment. It covers only that environment, with the capabilities
you choose in its access menu (read is always on), for MCP hosts on the server's machine and for
Ada webhooks. **Show token** gives the bridge token those hosts need; **Rotate token**
replaces it and disconnects hosts using the old one. Changing these needs access management
permission. A server run by the desktop app leaves its gateway to the app's own settings above.

Enable access per environment and select **Save** to apply permission changes. Default access allows
reading chats, creating threads, and sending messages. **Enable all environments** enables machines
without removing their existing permissions; it does not grant every capability. Choose **All
capabilities** in a machine's access menu to allow the full set, or grant individual capabilities
for controlling work, handling approvals, retrieving artifacts, managing reviews, or event delivery.

The assistant can use agents from the shared library for new chats, inspect work and approvals, control thread
lifecycle, and subscribe to events or webhook delivery when permitted. Agents are managed on the
Agents board; changing an agent does not change existing chats. Mobile Home opens to **Agents**: choose an agent to start a chat in an existing environment, or switch to **Threads** for all threads. Configure agents on web or desktop. Use `t3_list_environments`
to check the environment IDs and effective grants seen by the assistant. Permission errors also
report the granted and missing scopes.

`t3_list_threads`, `t3_list_projects`, `t3_list_agents`, and `t3_get_agents_view` cover every
connected machine with read access when `environmentId` is omitted. Each result names its
machine with `environmentId` and `environmentLabel`, and `environments` lists any machine that
was skipped (disconnected or without read access) or failed, so a missing chat is not mistaken
for one that does not exist. Pass `environmentId` to list one machine.

`t3_list_threads` returns the 20 most recently updated chats unless you pass `limit` (up to
100). When `hasMore` is true, pass `nextCursor` back as `cursor` with the same filters for the
next page. `updatedAfter`, `updatedBefore`, and `createdAfter` take ISO times to pick a window.
Each row is a summary; `t3_get_thread` returns the whole chat.

A chat's `profileId` and `profileName` name the agent it was created with, not the agent's
instructions. Pass `includeSystemPrompt: true` to `t3_list_agents` when you need each agent's
current prompt, for example before `t3_update_agent`.

### Answer an agent's questions through MCP

When an agent asks a question with answer options, its chat shows `waiting-input`, and
`t3_list_threads` marks it with `hasPendingUserInput` (pass `includeQuestions: true` to include
the questions). `t3_get_pending_questions` returns each question's full text, its options, whether
several options can be chosen, and whether a typed answer is accepted. `t3_answer_question`
answers with option labels or typed text, and the chat continues as if you had answered in the
app. Every question in the request needs an answer. Answering needs the same send access as
`t3_send_message`.

### Pause or stop work through MCP

Default access does not include pause or stop. In **Settings → Environments → MCP Gateway**, open the target
machine's access menu, enable **Control active work**, and select **Save**. This grants `control`
only for that environment. The broader `lifecycle` grant also permits thread controls, but neither
**All capabilities** nor access to other machines is needed. Use `t3_list_environments` to confirm
that the assistant sees the updated grant. A `scope_required` error means no control was dispatched;
`control` and `lifecycle` are alternatives, not two required grants.

`t3_pause_thread` requests an interruption of the active turn; it does not suspend a provider process.
`t3_stop_thread` requests stopping its provider session. Their `accepted` result acknowledges the
request, not its completion. Read `t3_get_thread` or watch the subsequent session/turn events to
confirm the outcome. An interrupted turn is reported as `interrupted`, and a stopped session as
`stopped`. A provider can finish normally before the interruption takes effect; `completed` is a
finished turn, not evidence that it was paused. Do not automatically resume or restart it.

These controls do not delete queued messages or pause a queue. A new message awaiting turn adoption
can still be reported as `queued` after a stop; inspect it separately before claiming all work has
stopped. A queued-only thread with no active turn cannot be paused. Sending a chat message asking
an agent to stop is cooperative: message acceptance alone does not prove the agent has stopped.

### Open a remote chat

In the installed desktop app, connect the remote environment and configure **Settings → Environments → MCP Gateway**
with your MCP assistant. Grant the environment read access. Your assistant can use `t3_open_thread`
with the environment and thread IDs to open that chat and bring this desktop window forward.
The remote machine supplies the chat; the desktop connected to the gateway displays it. Opening a
chat does not start or stop its agent. The desktop app must already be running and connected.

### Show a chat on another device

Your assistant can also put a chat on a different screen, for example when you talk to an assistant
on your laptop but watch Ada on your desktop. `t3_list_devices` lists the desktop, web, and
mobile apps connected to an environment, and shows which one you are looking at. `t3_focus_device`
then opens a chat on one of them by device ID or name. It can also open a file from that chat's
workspace beside the chat, such as a screenshot, video, PDF, or source file, or open the Agents board.
Desktop apps come to the front. Browser tabs switch to the chat but stay behind other windows. Phones
must have Ada open. On mobile, that request opens Home’s Agents tab.

A device appears once it connects to the environment directly, over your network or Tailscale. Desktop apps use the computer's name; browsers show as the browser and OS, such as "Chrome
on Windows".

### Organize work by agent

Open **Open agents** in the command palette, or visit `/agents`. Create a named agent with an icon,
optional roles, and a model; its thinking, allowed machines, system prompt, and other settings sit
under **Advanced**. Then start a task or an empty chat. Clicking a
card opens the conversation; **Back to agents** returns to the board. Settled work moves into a collapsed **Settled** section
in its agent column. Right-click a chat to settle or un-settle it. Deleting an agent keeps its conversations under **Removed agents**.

Hover a chat to read its recent messages and send a follow-up without leaving the board. The
preview updates live and shares your draft with the full chat. Attachments, approvals, and plan
responses use the full chat. While a chat is open, the compact list shows active work and
completed chats you have not viewed on this device. Your current chat stays visible until you
switch away; settled chats remain on the board under **Settled**.

Agents are shared across clients connected to the same server. Updated clients also synchronize
the agent library between connected environments that support agent sync, including after reconnecting. Each target resolves the provider and model locally; an unavailable or
ambiguous selection must be re-selected before starting a thread. Agent configuration and skill changes apply when a new chat is created. Existing chats keep the configuration and skill contents they started with.
Agent names ignore case, so "Doug" and "doug" cannot coexist. When synchronizing machines brings two
agents with the same name together, the one created later is renamed with a number, such as
"Doug (2)".

Add a short **Specialization** to show what an agent does on its details card and in MCP. This description does not replace its instructions.

Hover or keyboard-focus an agent in the left rail, or tap it on a touch screen, to see its details
and to edit, schedule, reorder, or delete it. Its roles are listed on the same card.

MCP assistants can discover agents with read access using `t3_list_agents`, or manage them using `t3_create_agent`, `t3_update_agent`, and `t3_delete_agent` with create
or admin access. Agent writes share only to connected environments with one of those grants;
check the returned sync failures. Use `profileId` with `t3_create_thread` to select an agent and its initial settings,
then `t3_send_message` to start work, or `t3_create_and_start_thread` to create the chat and send its opening task in one idempotent call. The environment-local `/mcp/workspace` endpoint exposes `list_agents` and `get_agents_view` with the same profile and state filters, using runs from its hosting machine. Agent listings include specializations without exposing system prompts. Use `t3_get_agents_view` to list agents alongside their chats and run status. Filter by `profileId`, `state` (`active`, `settled`, or `all`; active is the default and includes completed chats that have not been settled), and `executionState` (`running`, `queued`, `waiting-approval`, `waiting-input`, `completed`, `failed`, `interrupted`, `stopped`, or `idle`). Chats belonging to deleted agents appear under `orphanedRuns`. To follow one chat without polling, use `t3_wait_for_thread_status`, which returns the new status and a resume cursor when it changes or the bounded timeout elapses. Use `t3_unsettle_thread`
with lifecycle access to return a settled chat to the active list. `t3_open_agents` opens the
board in the connected desktop window with read access.

### Child chats and subagents

An agent can hand work to two different kinds of helper:

- A **child chat** is a full agent chat with its own context, launched to do a separate part of a
  larger task. A lead agent can run several children at once, for example two Doug chats and a
  Cody chat on different pieces of one feature. Each child keeps its own status, can be settled
  on its own, and has subagents of its own.
- A **subagent** is a helper inside one agent's own run, used to save that agent's context:
  native subagents such as Claude's Agent tool, or a `delegate_task` without an agent. Subagents
  never appear on the board or in the sidebar.

When an agent's chat creates chats through the MCP gateway (`t3_create_thread` or
`t3_create_and_start_thread`), its own `t3_thread_launch` or `create_threads`, or a
`delegate_task` run as a named agent, each new chat is a child of the chat that created it. This
happens without the agent doing anything extra. This works across machines too. Pass `parentThreadId` (with
`parentEnvironmentId` when that chat is on another machine) to attach a new chat to another
chat, or `parentThreadId: null` for a standalone chat. `t3_list_threads` accepts `parentThreadId` to list a chat's children. To regroup existing
chats, `t3_set_thread_parent` moves a chat under another chat on any machine, or detaches it
with `parentThreadId: null`; it needs lifecycle access. On the board, drag a run onto a card
from any connected machine.

On the Agents board, children appear inside the card of the chat that created them, including
chats by other agents, on the full board and in the side list next to an open chat. Subagents are
not cards: they appear only in the **Lineage** panel of the chat that owns them. On web and
desktop, a card's children start collapsed to one line counting them by state (need input,
running, waiting, failed, done); click it to show or hide them. Each card remembers your choice on
this device, shared with the same parent's row in the sidebar. Open, each child shows its agent,
title, and status; click it to open that chat.
Children that need your input come first, then ones still working or waiting, then failed, idle,
and finished ones, newest first within each group. The list re-sorts at most once a minute so rows
stay put while you read them. A card shows eight children until you choose **Show more**, but a
child that needs input always shows. Right-click a child for the same actions as a card.
**Pin to top of parent** keeps it first in its parent's list, and settling moves it into its
parent's collapsed **Settled** group. A live child chat whose parent is settled keeps its
own card, which names its parent's agent and chat; click that name to open the parent.

A card reads **In progress** while any child chat or subagent below it is still working, even
after its own turn finishes. It reads **Waiting** when nothing is working but something will
wake it or a chat below it later, such as a watched pull request, a background monitor, or a
scheduled task bound to the chat. A child chat starts with a **Child of** link to its parent, and a
parent's details list its **Children** with their status.

Manually settling a parent card also settles its child chats through the existing cascade.
Child chats on another machine follow over that machine's full-access link, or through the desktop
app; one that is offline catches up within a minute of answering again, for up to seven days.
Working child chats remain active and follow that manual choice when they finish. Un-settling
the parent restores chats that settled with it; ones you settled earlier stay settled.

Completing a turn leaves a card unsettled. Automatic settlement applies to each card's own
inactivity period, three days by default. Running child chats, subagents, monitoring,
watched pull requests, and pending questions or approvals keep a parent active. New activity and un-settling reset
the idle clock. Disable auto-settle on a card to keep it active indefinitely.

To link chats yourself on web and desktop, drag a card onto the middle of another card to make it a
child, or drag a child out of its card to make it independent. Dragging a child onto
another card moves it there. The board shows the move at once and puts it back, with the reason,
if it fails: a chat cannot go under itself or its own child chats, or under an archived chat. To
remove a chat from its parent without dragging, right-click it (or focus it and press the context
menu key) and choose **Remove from parent**. Deleting a chat leaves its child chats as their own
cards, and a chat left pointing at a missing parent is detached when the server starts.

### Schedule prompts for an agent

Open **Scheduled** on the Agents board, or choose **Schedule** from an agent's menu, to send
an agent a prompt at a set time (for example a deploy tonight) or on repeat (for example pulling
the latest changes every weekday at 7:00). Set **Destination** to **An agent's thread** and pick
the agent. Each task has one thread: the first run creates it and every later run posts into it.
This is the same list as **Settings → Scheduled tasks**, opened on **Agents**; choose **All**,
**Threads**, **New thread** or **Archived** to see the rest. To add another task to a chat that
already has one, choose **+** under **Automations** in its details. Pause, resume, run now, edit, or
delete a task from the list.

A task is kept on, and runs on, the machine that hosts its project. When you ask an agent in a chat
to schedule something, that is the chat's machine, not the device you are typing on, so the task
still runs after that device shuts down. Tasks run only while that machine's Ada server is up and it is awake;
Ada does not wake a sleeping machine or keep it awake. A run missed while it was off or asleep
happens once when it is back. For unattended runs, set the machine not to sleep and keep Ada running
with the desktop app open or as a [background service](./background-service.md). Runs use the agent's permission mode, so an agent that
asks for approvals waits for you. Changing a task's agent or project starts a new thread on the next
run. Agents in Ada chats schedule work for an agent with `schedule_task` and its `profileId`.
MCP assistants outside Ada can manage tasks with `t3_list_scheduled_tasks`, `t3_create_scheduled_task`,
`t3_update_scheduled_task`, and `t3_delete_scheduled_task` (create or admin access), and run one
immediately with `t3_run_scheduled_task` (send access). Pass `runAt` for a single run, or `cron`
with an optional IANA `timezone` for a repeating one, and an `idempotencyKey` to make a retried
create return the same task.

MCP assistants can keep a project's [TODO list](./thread-sidebar.md#keep-a-todo-list) with
`t3_list_todos` (read access) and `t3_add_todo`, `t3_update_todo`, `t3_settle_todo`,
`t3_unsettle_todo`, and `t3_remove_todo` (create or admin access). Settling marks a todo done
and is reversible; removing deletes it.

To start from a ready-made agent, select **New agent** on the Agents board, then **Preconfigured**.
Choosing one opens the agent editor already filled in with its instructions, model, modes, and
skills; change anything before saving. Saving adds its skills to the shared library, reusing any
skill you already have with identical content. If a preset's provider or model is not set up on
your machines, choose an available one before saving. Some presets list software they need for
full compatibility, such as a signed-in CLI.

Ask an assistant connected to the **Ada MCP** to create a shared skill and assign it to
an agent. For example: “Create a shared skill for reviewing pull requests and assign it to Randy.”
The MCP can list skills with read access and create, update, or delete them with create or admin
access. Only a chat running in full access with default mode can change skills or agents, since every
machine shares the library; a more limited chat can read it, and you can always edit it yourself.
One shared library supplies every assigned agent, regardless of provider.

For manual editing, open **Skills** on the Agents board and expand **Create or edit manually**.
Assign skills in the agent editor. Skills can include references, scripts, and binary assets beside
`SKILL.md`. When importing through MCP, include a `resources` list with each file's relative `path`,
base64-encoded `contentBase64`, and optional `executable` flag. Nested paths stay relative to the
skill folder; references are read only when needed. Each skill supports up to 256 files, 1 MiB per
file and 2 MiB of resources; the shared library supports 8 MiB of resources. On update, omitting
`resources` preserves the files, while supplying a list replaces them (`[]` removes them).

Update the Ada gateway, clients, and connected environments before using resource bundles. Older
environments cannot synchronize them. New chats receive the updated bundle; existing chats retain
their starting copy, including files. Deleting a skill excludes it from new chats.

To migrate previously imported skills that still refer to local folders, use the supported
[resource import utility](../operations/skill-resource-import.md). It verifies uploaded resources
before removing the local-folder workaround and preserves skill IDs and agent assignments.

Before creating an agent chat, Ada synchronizes its library from environments available to the client.
Keep both machines connected to a client at least once after an edit so the destination can
receive it. Offline machines catch up when they reconnect; a disconnected source that this
client has never seen cannot supply updates.

Each chat has generated instructions and assigned skill files under `.agents/t3/` in its workspace.
Ada creates these from the configuration saved when the chat was created and clears them when
the chat is settled. Continuing or resuming restores that same configuration, even if the agent
or shared skills have since been edited or deleted. Deleting an agent keeps its existing chats
and their saved instructions and skills.

Use the speed control on a chat card to choose a model-supported speed tier. The setting applies
to the next provider request, including when changed during a running turn; it does not restart
or accelerate a response already in progress.

MCP assistants can use `t3_handoff_thread` to move work from planning to implementation or from
code to review. Supply a summary, destination agent and project, a task, and optionally
workspace-relative text files such as `plan.md`. The destination receives a Markdown brief with
copied file contents, including across machines. Plans and handoff briefs remain available when
the source settles. Reuse the handoff UUID when
retrying, and inspect the returned status: `created` means the new chat exists but delivery needs
recovery. Settlement is a separate `t3_settle_thread` call after the user confirms. Handoff needs
read access on the source, artifact access when copying files, and create/send/artifact access on
the destination; settlement needs lifecycle access.

## Using the Desktop App as a Remote Only

If a computer should only drive work running elsewhere, turn off its local environment. In the
desktop app, open **Settings → Environments** and switch off **Local
environment**. Ada restarts without a local server: no local agents or terminals run, WSL
backends stay off, and other devices can no longer connect to this computer. Your projects,
history, and saved connections are kept, and you keep working through pairing or SSH.
If a [background service](./background-service.md) on this computer uses the same Ada home, the
app still treats it as this computer: **Open in** and file reveal for its projects run here,
whichever connection you reach it through.

Switch **Local environment** back on in the same place to restart with your previous local
settings.
